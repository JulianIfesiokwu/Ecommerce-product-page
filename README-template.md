### What I learned

I learnt how to built a Lightbox for images

H-w an overlay works
An overlay is a container that is placed over the whole page to make its -the page's- content inactive.
It has a width and height of the whole page and normally has a dark background to help the user focus on more important content- usually a modal.
At creation it has a height and width of 100% to cover the whole page,postion absolute to remove it from the normal flow of the DOM, A low opacity level.
Most importantly it has a high z-index to put the overlay ontop of all the page content but the overlay z-index is not higher than the modal content.
The z-index is not higher than the modal content to enable the modal be displayed above it.
The display property is initially set to none and activated by user action where it is set to block;
